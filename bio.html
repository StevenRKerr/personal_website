						I started out life as a physicist. Initially I worked on theoretical particle physics (lattice QCD), but 
						then switched to quantum gravity (topological quantum field theory and state sum models). 
					</p>
					
					<p>	
						After that, I turned my hand to economics. I worked on a grab-bag of different topics, including romantic matching,
						affirmative action, and an overhaul of the way economists model markets. 
					</p>

					<p>	
						(As an amusing aside; my <a href="http://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/14094/" target="_blank"> first thesis</a> was entitled "Topological 
						quantum field theory and quantum gravity". My <a href="https://era.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/36626" target="_blank"> second thesis</a> was 
						entitled "Economics and stuff")
					</p>

					<p>
						From there I worked in the private sector as a data scientist, before unexpectedly falling back into academia. I'm currently a Chancellor's fellow at the University of Edinburgh, doing research in health data science, statistics and machine learning.						
					</p>

						I am interested in effective charitable interventions, particularly those aimed at improving animal welfare. I have been involved in various combat sports (Brazilian jiu-jitsu, boxing, freestyle wrestling, MMA) 
						since I was a teenager, at times competitively. I also play violin, with varying levels of success.
