					I started out life as a physicist. Initially I worked on theoretical particle physics (lattice QCD), but 
					then I switched to quantum gravity (topological quantum field theory and state sum models). 
					
					After that, I turned my hand to economics. I worked on a smogasbord of different topics, including romantic matching,
					affirmative action, and overhauling the way economists model markets. 

					From there I worked in the private sector as a data scientist, which I continue today. I also somehow
					fell back into academia, at least partly. I currently do research on the epidemiology of COVID-19 through
					<a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/usher/eave-ii">EAVE II</a>, which is a data platform consisting of clinical and demographic
					information for the population of Scotland. We have published a number of important 
					<a href=https://www.ed.ac.uk/usher/eave-ii/key-outputs/our-publications>research articles</a> on COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness
					and safety.
