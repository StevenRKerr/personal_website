				<p> My CV can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/10DLdTy1znrrJVYLDwfGLoNiBAwMgBtk1/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank"> here</a>. </p>

					I started out life as a physicist. Initially I worked on theoretical particle physics (lattice QCD), but 
					then switched to quantum gravity (topological quantum field theory and state sum models). 
				
				<p>	
					After that, I turned my hand to economics. I worked on a smogasbord of different topics, including romantic matching,
					affirmative action, and an overhaul of the way economists model markets. 
				</p>

				<p>
					From there I worked in the private sector as a data scientist, which I continue today. I somehow also
					fell back into academia, at least partly. I currently do research on the epidemiology of COVID-19 through
					<a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/usher/eave-ii" target="_blank">EAVE II</a>, which is a data platform consisting of clinical and demographic
					information for the entire population of Scotland. We have published a number of important 
					<a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/usher/eave-ii/key-outputs/our-publications/quick-access-list" target="_blank">research articles</a> on COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness
					and safety.						
				</p>
				
				<p>
					I am interested in <a href= "https://www.effectivealtruism.org/ target="_blank"">effective altruism</a>, and since 2007 I have 
					donated 20% of my income to charity. I have been involved in various combat sports (Brazilian jiu-jitsu, boxing, freestyle wrestling, MMA) 
					since I was a teenager, at times competitively. I also play violin, with varying levels of success.
