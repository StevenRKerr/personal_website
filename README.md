# personal_website

This repository contains the complete set of code that is used to build my personal website [here](https://drstevenkerr.com).

It is hosted as a static website on Amazon s3. I use [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), which is particularly useful for hosting a blog as a static website. Altogether 
makes for a very quick-loading, highly available, and low-cost website!
