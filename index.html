				<p>
					I'm primarily a mathematician and a data scientist. However I have applied those skills in a number of different fields.
					I hold PhDs in physics and economics, and I am currently a Chancellor's fellow at the Usher Institute, The University of Edinburgh.
					My work is primarily in health data science, epidemiology, cryptography and statistics. 
				</p>
				<p>
					This page has some information about me, my work, publications, interests, and a blog where you can read my thoughts on topics 
					related to science, data, and anything else that takes my fancy.
