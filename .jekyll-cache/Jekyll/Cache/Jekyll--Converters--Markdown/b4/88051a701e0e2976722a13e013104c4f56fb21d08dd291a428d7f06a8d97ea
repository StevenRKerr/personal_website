<h3>  What is linear regression? </h3>

<p>It’s one of the first major topics you learn about when taking statistics class. In essence, it allows you to model the mean of a response variable \( y_i \)  as depending on some explanatory variables \( X_i \), where the subscript \( i = 1…n \) labels different observations. More concretely,</p>

<p>\begin{align} y = X \beta + \epsilon, \tag{1} \end{align}</p>

<p>where \( y \) is an \( n \) -dimensional vector whose elements are \( y_i \), and \( X \) is an \( n \times k \) matrix whose rows are \( X_i \). If we assume that</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>\begin{align} \mathbb{e</td>
      <td>X} = 0, \tag{2} \end{align}</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>then</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>\begin{align} \mathbb{y</td>
      <td>X} = X \beta, \tag{3} \end{align}</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
