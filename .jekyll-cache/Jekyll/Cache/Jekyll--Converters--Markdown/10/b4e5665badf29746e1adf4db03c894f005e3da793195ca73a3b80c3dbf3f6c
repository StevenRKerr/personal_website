<h3>  The holy grail of theoretical physics </h3>

<p>For many decades now, physicsists have been trying to â€˜uniteâ€™ quantum mechanics and Einsteinâ€™s general relativity into a quantum theory of gravity. Achieving such a unification is one of the major outstanding problems in theoretical physics.</p>

<h3>  Why don't quantum mechanics and general relativity play together nicely? </h3>

\[y = x^2\]
