<h3>  What is expected utility theory? </h3>

<p>Expected utility theory was first influentially expounded upon by Swiss mathematician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Bernoulli" target="_blank"> Daniel Bernoulli</a> in the 1700s. It seeks to answer the question of how to weigh up alternatives that are uncertain. For example, say I gave you the option of \( £100 \), or a bet consisting of a \( 50-50 \) chance of receiving \( £250 \), how should you choose? While it may seem easy to answer a single question like this, it turns out that building a general framework for how to make such decisions is not so easy, and if you proceed naively you can come to some strange conclusions.</p>

<p>Bernoulli’s basic idea is that you should assign a number to how good each possible state of the world is, multiply it by the probability that state of the world will actually happen, and sum it all up. The result number is called the ‘expected utility’, and the theory instructs us to choose maximise it. In my example, let’s say the utility of a quanity of money is equal to the quantity of money itself. The expected utility of the certain \( £100 \) is</p>

\[1 \times 100 = 100.\]

<p>While the expected utility of the bet is</p>

<p>\(0.5 \times 0 + 0.5 \times 250 = 125\).</p>

<p>In this example, the bet comes out on top. However, there is no reason we need to assign utility to be equal to the quantity of money received. Maybe the benefit we derive from receiving \( £250 \) is less than twice the benefit we would get from receiving \( £100 \). In this case, expected utility theory would instruct us to go for the sure thing.</p>

<h3>  The von-Neumann-Morgenstern utility theorem </h3>

<p>How do we know that this way of evaluating uncertain prospects is sensible? Well, the theory got a major boost from John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern, who proved a rather striking result in 1947. They showed that a decision-maker who behaves in accordance with four seemingly very reasonable axioms <i>must</i> be an expected utility maximiser. What are these four axioms?</p>

<p>Let’s first define \( \succeq \) to mean `at least as good as’. We will call refer to an uncertain prospect as a <i>lottery</i>. The axioms are as follows:</p>

\[\begin{enumerate}
\item{1. Completeness}
\end{enumerate}\]
